# Employee Directory

## Description

A website which pulls random users from an api and allows the user to sort through them.

## User Story

As a business manager, I want to be able to easily view non-sensitive information on my employees and view specific employees with ease.


## Table of Contents
* [Usage](#usage)
* [Demo](#demo)
* [Contact](#contact)

## Usage

Upon downloading the necessary files, within the console run the command:

```bash
npm i
```
This will begin installing the necessary extra packages needed to run the application. They are already defined within the package.json so git will recognize what needs to be specifically installed, saving the user time it would take to install each package individually.

The program will be started by using the following command:

```bash
npm run start
```
Once the server is active, the browser will open and the app will be fully functional!


## Demo

The home page of the application looks like this:

![home](https://github.com/luvwitch/EmployeeDirectory/blob/main/public/home.png?raw=true)

You can filter employees alphabetically in ascending or descending order by clicking "name" at the top of the table, or find specific employees by typing in the search box.
